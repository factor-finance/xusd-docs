# About Factor

## Vision

DeFi projects have stopped making sense: Ponzi schemes, byzantine tokenomics, and airdrop frenzies. Factor will build the boring projects that glue the world together: liquid stable yieldcoin, asset indexes, and yield indexes. Factor will design ecosystems that encourage long term holders, build real value, and establish trust.

Factor's start is XUSD, a stable yieldcoin that is [live on Avalanche](https://app.xusd.fi) (based on Ethereum [OUSD](https://ousd.com/) under MIT/AGPL license). Avalanche (and other challenger chains) offer better risk-adjusted returns now and for the foreseeable future. Further, ethereum gas is not affordable for most users and burdens protocols. XUSD will yield comes from top tier strategies targeting ~10-20% expectancy. XUSD will go cross-chain. The protocol and new strategies are under active development and audits, so stay in touch in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ETE7ksP8Fd) to hear about release.

Factor's governance token, FACT, will launch in early 2022.

## Future product plans

### Crypto asset indexes
No one has succeeded in building good, decentralized, on-chain indexes yet. It's not a sexy product, but asset diversification is a rare free lunch.

### AMM yield indexes
A protocol for building diverified exposure to AMM pool yields would be a perfect fit for the Factor vision.
