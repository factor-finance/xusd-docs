# Interest bearing stablecoin
### Stable value
* 1 XUSD = $1
* Maintained by incentivized arbitrage

### Instantly fungible
* Permissionless mint and redeem using major stablecoins (USDC, DAI, USDT)

### Generate yield on stablecoins
* Invests in ultra-low volatility, market neutral strategies
* Extensible and configurable strategy set
* e.g. lending on Aave, liquidity providing on curve.fi

### Distribute yield through supply rebasing
* The amount of XUSD in all wallets increases when gains are realized

### Lowest barrier of entry for DeFi yields
* SEC-qualified custodians can hold ERC20 tokens, but cannot give DeFi access
* No self-custody/contract interactions are required to capture DeFi yields via XUSD
* Centralized exchanges and custody tools can support XUSD on behalf of users

### Initial launch on Avalanche C-Chain
* Low gas fees
* More than $10 billion of native and ethereum-bridge wrapped stablecoins
* Strong [incentive programs](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/avalanche-foundation-announces-180m-defi-incentive-program-d320fdfafff7)
* Established DeFi protocols operating (Aave, curve.fi, Pangolin, and so many others)
